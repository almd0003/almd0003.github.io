            Hello! My name is Maryam, I am 18 years old, I was born on March 8<sup>th</sup> 2006. I just recently graduated high school earlier this year and I am <em>excited</em> for what my future has for me. I am the oldest of 4 children and I have a <em>beautiful</em> cat named Moza. I grew up in Ottawa but I hope to explore more of the world.

            I am very interested in interactive media design. I took very similar courses in high school and I thought this program would be perfect for me. I have learned HTML and CSS in high school but I am very glad that I get to review them and learn them again so that I can have that expertise.
